# Roll A Ball

I followed the tutorial for roll a ball to first implement the base
game. I then found some online resources to help me figure out how to
implement a basic jump
(https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/movement/physics/). This
resulted in me being able to jump an infinite amount of times. I then
modified this so that I could only jump once, and not while I was in the
air. I finally modified the jumping a second time to allow for double
jumps.
